%% Part 1

% Q1 - Q3:  Matrix Operations (HW2) (Lec2)
% 
% Q4 - Q5:  Solving Systems of Linear Equations ? you just need to 
%           know how to set up the matrix equation ? you won?t
%           have to solve the equations (HW2,3-1, Lab2,3)
% 
% Q6:  Writing a Force Balance Matrix Equation (HW2,3-1, Lab3)
% 
% Q7 - Q9: Numerical Differentiation (HW4, Lab5)
% 
% Q10 - Q11: Numerical Integration (HW5, Lab7,8)
% 
% Q12: Newton Raphson Algorithm (HW4, Lab6)

%% Part 2

% You will write two short scripts (26 points each)
% One script file will be on numerical differentiation and the second will be on numerical integration
% You will have access to the same formula sheet that is provided for Part I.
% You will use MATLAB for this part
% OK to look at your old scripts
% No internet (other than your Blackboard section to submit work), no Power Point slides, no calculators, no cell phones
